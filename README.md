# boingorefresh

Made for Macs, only tested on OSX Mavericks and Yosemite. 

USAGE

1) Make this script executable.

`cd /path/to/this/boingorefresh`

`sudo chmod +x boingorefresh.sh`

2) Run it when you're out of free wifi.
`./boingorefresh`

It will get you a new MAC address, restart your wifi connection, then ask the router for a new IP address. You may need to clear browser cookies (or use incognito mode) to visit the login site to get free wifi again.

Happy travels!
